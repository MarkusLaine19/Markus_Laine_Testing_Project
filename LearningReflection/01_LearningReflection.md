> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- The Webapp was easy to use and very simple, so it was nice to test it. 
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I used teachers example as a guide on how to do my own test cases. I had GitLab open on my second screen where I ran the test cases.
On my my screen I had visual studio code open where I wrote the test cases steps
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -    I think that excel is a good tool to use for test case managment as seen in some of the examples in course material 


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
-   I had some troubles at launching GitLab. Sometimes it got stuck on the screen where it checked my internet connections security.
I tried to check my connection speed and use different links to get to GitLab. I also checked that my connection is secured.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I have used Github before in my studies while completing other courses.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I would automate with Robot Framework because it is easy for people to understand even if they are not that much into coding.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Robot Framework, Good Communication and team work skills, Basic understanding of some code languages for example python, CI/CD skills



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- I would have to take online courses to learn more about automation tools and frameworks like Robot Framework, Cypress and Selenium. Also to learn more about
Performance testing tools.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas?
-This project was really useful and it helped me to put theoretical knowledge into practice. I feel like I learn more and better while actually doing things myself rather than studying theory. Writing the learning reflection report was useful cause it made me think about what testing could be like in the field of work.
